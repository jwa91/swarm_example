### Python Function Example

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    sum = a + b
    return sum
```

This is a basic example of how to define a function in Python. The function `add_numbers` takes two parameters and returns their sum. Make sure to follow the proper indentation as it is crucial in Python.
